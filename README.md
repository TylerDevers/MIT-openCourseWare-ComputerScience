As I work through the engineering and computer science degree, I will push my solutions to the course material here.

6.00cs is the introduction to the curriculum. It introduces Python as the first programming language.

added whatIHaveLearned.doc to document the tools that I have picked up. added test.py so that I can more easily test ideas outside of the official code.

I found problem set 3 to be too dificult for me. I absorbed as much as I could but eventually used the solution code that was given to get the project to work.
