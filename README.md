As I work through the engineering and computer science degree, I will push my solutions to the course material here.

6.00cs is the introduction to the curriculum. It introduces Python as the first programming language.

added whatIHaveLearned.doc to document the tools that I have picked up. added test.py so that I can more easily test ideas outside of the official code.
