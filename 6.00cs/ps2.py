# Problem #1
# Implement the evaluate_poly function. This function evaluates a polynomial function for the
# given x value. It takes in a tuple of numbers poly and a number x. By number, we mean
# that x and each element of poly is a float. evaluate_poly takes the polynomial represented
# by poly and computes its value at x. It returns this value as a float.

#
def eval_poly(*poly):
    polynomial = poly
    return polynomial

print eval_poly(1)

#for each poly with a power of x, place that poly where x equals the index of a tuple
