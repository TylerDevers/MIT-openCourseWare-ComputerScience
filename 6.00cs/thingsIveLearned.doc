This is a list of things I have learned while writing these programs:

Hangman exercise:
.lower() - the lower method is used to modify a string. It is not lowercase().

list() - the list function can change a string into a list. list(string_name) does the trick

.join() - the join method can turn a list into a string. This one is strange to me, since for it to work the string must put before the method, and the list is the arguement. so ''.join(list) would return a string of the list. this can be assigned to a variable, string_variable = ''.join(list)

.format() - to embed a variable within a string, enclose the variable name within braces inside the string. then use the format method on the string. Put whatever we like within the braces, then link it to the variable in the arguement of the format method after the end of the string.
  name = "tyler"
  print "Hello {best_name}, that is the perfect name!".format(best_name=name)

printing the index - to print the indices of a list, use brackets then colon after the list name. hence list[:] will print the entire range of indexes from the list.

I can modify and change a list index by embedding the index() method within the list brackets. The code below takes a guess index and assigns it a value. the guess index is based upon the index value of another list all together.
  if number_to_insert in insert:
    guess[insert.index(number_to_insert)] = number_to_insert
    insert[insert.index(number_to_insert)] = "?"


problem set 3 word games wordgames

These word games will be similar to scrabble and will be saved as ps3a.py. This is a test driven development exercise, or unit testing, and my solutions will be tested by test_psa.py.

problem 1 word scores - the first function get_word_score will calculate the score for the players word.
