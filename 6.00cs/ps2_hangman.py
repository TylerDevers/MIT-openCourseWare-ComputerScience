Will probably need ot convert guess and avail_letters to list to iterate over them, then .join them together. Need to print out dashes instead of the word to mimic a missing word, then replace those dashes with the correct letter guess. Perhaps make a list of dashes that can be iterated over to replace the dashes using the index"""
